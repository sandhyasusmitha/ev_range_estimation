The given values in "Ah" column shows the amount of amp-hour discharge from the battery with time. So, by adding the nominal amp-hour i.e. 2.9Ah, to all the values and dividing it again by 2.9Ah we will get out our target variable, SOC.

Similarly, the given values in "Wh" column shows the amount of watt-hour discharge from the battery with time. Panasonic 18650PF has a maximum energy capacity of 9.9Wh. So, by adding the maximum energy capacity to all the values and dividing it again by 9.9Wh, we will get our other target variable, SOE.
